Ultrasonic Distance Monitor

    This project is an Arduino-based system that uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to nearby objects.
    The distance is displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen. If an object comes closer than 50 cm, a buzzer is triggered. 
    The LCD display automatically turns off when nothing is detected within 4 meters and turns back 
    on when an object reappears.
